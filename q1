Consider the following Java class.

public class Wizard{

  Spell[] spells;
  Potion[] potions;
  String name;
  int points=0;
  
  public Wizard(String name){
    this.name = name;}
    
}

A.  Write a method for the Wizard class named "powerUp" that adds 10 to the field "points".
public void powerup{points){
points=this.points+10;}

B.  Write a method "cast" that casts the n-th element of the "spells" array.  
public cast (int n){
return spells[n];}
 
    Include an interface (seperately) for the Spell class to insure your "cast" method will interact with the class.
    public interface MagicUser{
     public cast();}
C.  Write a "hello" method that prints an introduction stating the name of the Wizard.
    public static void main hello(){
    System.out.println("hi my name is wizard"+ "and"+ this.name);}
D.  Write a main method for the Wizard class.  In it construct a wizard with name "Harry Poppins".  Use the hello() method.
 public static void main (String[] args){
 wizard TheMainWizard = new wizard("Harry Poppins");
 TheMainWizard.hello();}
