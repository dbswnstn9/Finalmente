    Describe the structure and purpose of a Merkle Tree.
    This is formed like Tree, so there are some branches that include hash information. These have an advantage can test whether the other files was changed or not.
    What is the Merkle root?
    Merkle root is a value which is located Merkle path, and among the values Merkel root is located at the top of the Tree.
